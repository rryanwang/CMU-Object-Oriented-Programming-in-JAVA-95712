2005-10-24	Sun Spectrum Communications Organization, Inc., et al. 	Federal	032 3032			According to the Commission, the defendants targeted consumers with poor credit, offering major credit cards with a $2,500 limit for an advance fee of $197 to $300. The telemarketers claimed to have information showing that the consumers recently had been denied credit, and pitched the credit card offer as a means of improving their credit rating. Implying that they were merely verifying data, the defendants requested information about the consumer s bank accounts, such as account numbers, routing numbers, and the account holder s name, as well as personal identifying information, such as date of birth, mother s maiden name, and Social Security number. They also allegedly misrepresented that they had the ability and authority to issue major credit cards. A group of U.S. and Canadian telemarketers will pay $415,000 to settle Federal Trade Commission charges they were selling nonexistent credit cards to U.S. consumers, the agency announced today. The defendants are banned from selling credit-related products through telemarketing and must stop their attempts to deceive consumers into giving out their personal financial information.
